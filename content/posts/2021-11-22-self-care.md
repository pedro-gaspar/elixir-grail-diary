Today was my first self-care day at Remote 🧘‍♀️.

My initial thoughts ...

> I don't need to stop for a day. I've only started a couple of weeks ago and I'm learning and having fun so why stop?

After mentioning this to my team lead she replied:

> It's a day to take care of yourself. You should do it and take some pics and share.

So I went and check what was exactly the self-care day:

> This is a date where everyone at Remote is encouraged to take the day off and do something they love and specifically to create awareness of the importance of self-care, mental health awareness, and taking a break during the Pandemic.

Well, that got me thinking (and googling) a bit more about self-care 🤔.

> Self-care is not synonymous with self-indulgence or being selfish. Self-care means taking care of yourself so that you can be healthy, you can be well, you can do your job, you can help and care for others, and you can do all the things you need to and want to accomplish in a day.

Over the years I've neglected myself, a lot 😥. 

I have had this self-neglect pattern over the years. I've lost self-care with too much focus on work, resulting in a poor work-life balance ... more a work-no-life balance.

I'm overweight, with high blood pressure, and lack of energy and sleepiness. I don't remember a good night's sleep in a long time. When any of the kids get sick it only gets worse 😿.

But it got a lot worse after my second daughter was born. You end up forgetting about yourself and putting your kids first, which is what being a parent means. 

But remember the definition of self-care:

> Self-care means taking care of yourself so that you can .... help and care for others...

New years eve is always the time where you decide to break the pattern, but it lasts for a couple of weeks, and then you slowly forget about yourself and get to the old patterns.

I've taken vacations for self-care but in the end, I was even more tired. Kids, you know...

And many times, what seemed like self-care ended up being the opposite. Relentlessly watching talks, doing online courses and reading books to fight impostor syndrome. Feels good at the moment, but you end up being a lot more tired in the end. 

Or binging Netflix, surely you are resting, but you are just eating popcorns or something worse while you are at it.

So thank you Remote 🙏 for providing me a day to remind me to take care of myself. If I do that well, I can do my job even better and I plan on doing just that.

First things first, I opted to do my self-care day in a day where I didn't have my wife and kids at home. Sounds a bit selfish, but I needed some space to breathe and think.

I could have spent the day napping and resting which I needed a lot. But I knew that, even though it helps a bit, that wouldn't pay great dividends.

So I decided to this would be a day to be active. Jumpstart the engine to be more active and healthy.

Use the day to **break the pattern** of the old habits, so I walked **33 000 steps, about 24km** 😱. It's crazy and I know it's not sustainable but I wanted to make this day different and remember it for a while. Had plenty of time to think and reflect on moving forward.

> Next self-care day I'll be 15 kg lighter and with plenty of energy.  💪

For that to happen I'll try ... NO ... I WILL be more aware of myself, strive to have more self-care and self-discipline. 

But even though I know the recipe to achieve that goal and I do it from time to time, I slowly forget about it and fall into the same traps. 

That is the problem. It's easy setting goals and starting. But it's really hard to have the consistency to keep doing the same thing for a long time until you reach your goals. 

And more important than reaching the goals, is **keeping** the healthy habits. 

I need to the habit of self-care and self-discipline about taking care of myself be part of my life

Will Smith, besides being the Prince of Bel-Air, also has some wisdom to share.

> Self-discipline is the definition of self-love.

It's time to break the bad patterns and make self-care a part of my **daily routine**. A **habit** that needs repetition and consistency to become part my life. 

And in the next self-care day, it won't be a time to be remembered by Remote about self-care, but a day to celebrate self-care in my life 🎉
