I really 😍 Elixir. Up until a week ago, it was an old passion that I had, but...

> Passion without action remains a dream

This quote is damn perfect. Indeed I wasn't passionate about Elixir. It was just a dream.
Even though dreaming is fantastic, especially if you are a parent, you end up waking to reality and feeling sad about it.
Time to REALLY learn Elixir!

To reach the **Holy Grail of Elixir** I need to slowly find clues and build a map that will guide me in my journey.

# The map
