About 3 months ago I was deeply focused on writing and learning. I was in the zone, in a state of [flow](https://leaddev.com/culture-engagement-motivation/why-flow-matters-more-passion).

I stopped because I finally decided not to wait longer and work in Elixir full time so I applied to [Remote](https://remote.com).

Had a lot of fun doing their coding challenge in Elixir and after a bit of waiting I got a job offer 🎉.

Since my first month would be an Elixir boot camp, I decided for a break on the blog and on learning Elixir. 

Had to give one month's notice on my previous gig, and then I started working for Remote and it has been pretty great ❤️.  

I plan on writing about it, but I'm waiting for the honeymoon phase to pass so that it isn't biased. 

I'm constantly thinking what Lilly from the tv series "How I met your mother" used to say when someone was telling an amazing story.

> This sounds amazing. But where's the poop? 💩

Haven't found it so far. 🤞

But I never got the habit back again of writing 😥. 

This is just inertia, god damn you, Newton. 

Newton's first law, also called the "law of inertia", states that an object at rest remains at rest, and an object that is moving will continue to move straight and with constant velocity, if and only if there is no net force acting on that object.

I need to make an effort to fight the inertia and keep the habit of writing rolling to gain momentum.

No need to overthink it, just write something daily that will be helpful to my future self. 
And if it is useful to others that's the cherry on top of the cake 🍒.

So let's get started ... again 🏃
