Richard Feynman is a known physicist that promoted the following learning technique, known as **The Feynman Technique**.

- Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade.
- Identify gaps in your explanation. Then, go back to the source material to understand it better.
- Organize and simplify.
- Transmit

Learn Elixir and put my knowledge to the test by teaching at the same time. 

> Learning in the open.

So I'm going to start a series of posts around building an application with Elixir.

For that, we will try to build a blog brother app, **the grail-toolbox**.

It will be an app that will have the following features:

- post into my Twitter account a tweet every time there's a new blog post
- post in medium a copy of each new blog post
- create a JSON API with all recent tweets from JosÃ© Valim
- scrape posts from Dashbit, store a summarized version in a database to expose has a Graphql endpoint

Let's learn and have fun ðŸ˜Ž

Subject to changes along the way.
