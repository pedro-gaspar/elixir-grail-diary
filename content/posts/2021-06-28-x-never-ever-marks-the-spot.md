I’ve come across Elixir a couple of years ago. José Valim, the Brazilian developer rockstar, was making a lot of posts about it on Twitter.

I immediately started feeling [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) 

Coming from a Ruby on Rails background, it seemed incredible. All the goodies of Rails and none of the weaknesses of Ruby. The syntax looked familiar, and the rendering times were displayed with a character I had never seen...

> &micro; seconds ... micro ... MICRO SEEEECONDS 😱

So I started to learn a bit about it, for that I followed a path similar to Rails. First, learn the framework and then learn the language. I bought **Programming Phoenix** and started learning and having fun.

With the help of the book, I built a couple of small projects and was really enjoying it a lot. I was falling in love. 

After tinkering a bit with it, I built simple things, but I never felt comfortable with the language. Moreover, I lacked experience in developing a _real-world TM_ application.

> Even though I didn't know why it felt right.❤️

However, trying to advocate it in the place I worked was a frustrating experience. So I switched gears and joined a startup using Elixir in some internal projects, but I was primarily working in front-end land with React while there. One of the goals of that job was to gain knowledge and experience with Elixir, but I could not do it because I never had the chance there.

Then life happens, and time flies…

A couple of years later, I find myself looking back and regretting not pushing myself to work in Elixir full-time. I miss the fun times of reading and learning about it. The sense of a quest, of finding a hidden treasure.

As I’m getting older, I notice that even though age doesn’t bring wisdom, it does provide some clarity. Your days on Earth aren’t unlimited, so better start living them to the fullest.

Dave Thomas has pretty good advice.

> The Most Important Rule 
Explore, make mistakes, and try wild things.  
And most of all, _have fun_.

Not a new year's resolution but an upcoming life goal. 

**I want to have fun working fulltime using Elixir 🥳**. 

But for that to happen, I need to learn it and have a lot more experience.

Like all treasures, the path to discovering them isn’t clear. It requires a lot of research, learning, and failing along the way. And…

I’ll use this blog as a diary containing all my findings to face the final challenge with confidence so that I can choose wisely. Drink from the right cup, the holy grail of Elixir knowledge.
