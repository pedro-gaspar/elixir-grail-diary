# How to learn things quickly.

Learn things in a way that allows us to go from not knowing anything about a skill to being really good in a short period of time. In a process that is fun and exciting.

# 10 000 hours rule

10 000 hours rule to learn something keeps coming up.

The more time you spend on a skill, the better you get.

> The best in the world have spent more than 10 000 hours over a period of 10 years practicing.

But that is if you want to be the very best in a skill. But that is for ultracompetitive easily rank performance fields. Very specific.

It was lost in translation, and now it takes 10 000 hours to learn anything.

# It only takes around 20 hours

But that is not true, you can spend a little bit of time going from knowing absolutely nothing, with a little bit of practice and becoming very good in a short period of time.

20 hours is enough for going from knowing nothing to being an expert, about 40 mins a day, for about a month.

# Steps to learn faster

1. Decide what you want (how does it look like). Target performance level
2. Deconstructing that skill. Break skill on smaller parts to learn
3. Research just enough to identify the essential subskills (books, courses, DVDs). The trick is not to allow the research to procrastinate. 3/5 resources, but don't go over them thoroughly. Just see things that are common in all of them
4. Removing barriers to practice (remove the distractions)
5. Pre-commit to 20 hours or not do it at all (is it important to you)

In deconstruction, if you are doing too simple, it is probably right.

Repetition is important.

# 3 phases of learning

1. Really thinking about what you are doing
2. Interrelating (starting to do on your own)
3. Automatic (just do it)

> You can learn anything.
