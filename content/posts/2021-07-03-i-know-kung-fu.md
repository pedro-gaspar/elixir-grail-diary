Today I completed the course [Elixir & OTP](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir#buy) from Pragmatic studio.

I highly recommended it. Even though it's not a comprehensive course, it touches on the key concepts in a friendly manner.

Throughout the course, you build a small and _humble_ HTTP server and Phoenix Framework clone. When finishing each video, you are asked to complete a small set of exercises to practice what you just learned.

I felt a similar positive reaction to what I felt a while back when I finished the [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/).

You say out loud...

But even though this is cool, nowadays you know better. 
You only feel the **illusion of competence**.

Remembering what I wrote in [How To Remember Everything You Learn](https://elixirgraildiary.com/posts/2021-06-27-how-to-remember-everything-you-learn/), to remember and build upon what I learned, I need to use some of the techniques:

- Recall
- Feynman Technique
- Spaced Repetition

I've also been doing the [Exercism](https://exercism.io) Elixir track, so some concepts are being cemented from practice each day that surely covers the **Spaced Repetition**.

Going to do **Recall**, by doing a quick read of each video notes.

And finally, use the **Feynman Technique**, learn by teaching. For that, I will try to cover similar topics by writing a small tutorial series called, wait for it ... **The Elixir Tutorial**.
